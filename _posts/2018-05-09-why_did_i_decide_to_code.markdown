This goes way back.

I'm officially a college drop out, several colleges actually, 3 to be exact, different degrees also, International Relations, Marketing, Textile and Fashion Design, Graphic Design, also concluded a course on Makeup Artistry. When I dropped out and decided college wasn't really for me or I wasn't really sure of what I was doing anymore, I ended up working with a friend at his marketing agency (he did get a degree for this). 
It was probably the only way I couldv'e learned every single thing I know now. 

The strong graphic design background I had, didn't really come from studying, it came from me trying to get cool images, also from trying to be a blogger and getting material for my social media, videos and blog, which was about me being a makeup artist. Studying whatever I studied just gave me the actual knowledge of how things were "meant" to be done and for me not to spend hours trying to figure something out. 

So when I started working, I realized the agency was led the exact same way. He was doing websites, social media and marketing was a plus. He is good at it, but I started realizing that it would take him just a little too long to get certin things done, like it happened to me before, files would be weird, or websites had tiny errors or wouldn't be "entirely modifiable", which was an issue, since we'd buy templates and just modify them to fit whatever the client needed. Sometimes this would end up meaning that we'd buy extra plug ins, spend extra hours, extra everything. Horrible, right?

I thought maybe, just maybe, I could do what I've done before, learn the right way to get it done. I googled and found a course on Web Design, in 6 weeks I'd be able to do Wordpress sites, and basic HTML.  

I obviously needed more knowledge on the matter. 

The course was THE. MOST. BASIC. THING. HTML, CSS, Muse (what?), Photoshop for building websites and Wordpress. Don't even think we went deeply into anything. But I thought, well this is it. It was ultra different when I began trying to help.

I was only able to change colors, modify the layout that was premade, basically, at least to me, nothing. I just really wanted to be able to put whatever my brain imagined a website should look like on screen, I was stuck.

That's where I thought maybe it wasn't my thing, and I went back to college and tried again, didn't work, I got pregnant! 

After my son was born I actually thought I had to figure out what to do? Where did I want to go? Should I continue as a graphic designer? But I wanted to do more. 

After a year and a half I started Googling, trying to figure it out, I found a few courses, got accepted to two of them, but I didn't feel they were complete enough. I had seen Flatiron School before, when I took the first course. I went back, started doing the bootcamp, applied, I had nothing to lose.

And here I am. My biggest struggle is time, wish I had much more, I enjoy it so much I sometimes realize I've spent extra time when I only meant to do 2 hours at the moment. I have gotten frustrated, but it doesn't make me want to stop, other tasks make me stop, like my job or family time. :)
